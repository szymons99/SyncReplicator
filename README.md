# SyncReplicator
SyncReplicator is a simple, robust command-line tool written in C# for one-way synchronization of folders. It is designed to keep a replica folder as an exact, up-to-date copy of a source folder, with all operations logged both to the console and to a log file.
Run the program with four required arguments: dotnet run "<source_path> <replica_path> <interval_seconds> <log_file_path>"
